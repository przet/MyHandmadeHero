- In VS2019 if I build in debug 64 I get a msvccrtd.lib unresolved external...looks like crt libraryd for 64 bit is not included 
(or something to make it work). We have user32.lib and Gdi32.lib included. Maybe we need the 64 bit versions if we wanted to build
in 64? 
- does it matter what initial value of waswasdown is?
- why did the uint lparam not work? 
- WasWasDown Needed to be WasDown NOT Is Down (WasWasDown is to represent the 3rd state - the state before the previous state. )

- how does WPARAM/LPARAM work (polymorphically)
